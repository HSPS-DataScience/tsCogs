## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tsCogs)
library(tidyr)
library(rbokeh)
library(htmltools)

d <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer, class) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(panel = map_plot(data,
                          ~ figure(xlab = "City mpg", ylab = "Highway mpg") %>%
                            ly_points(cty, hwy, data = .x)))

bob <- d %>%
  trelliscope(name = "city_vs_highway_mpg", path = "one_trelli",
              self_contained = TRUE)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

<iframe src="one_trelli/index.html"><\iframe>


```{r}
library(tsCogs)
library(tidyr)
library(rbokeh)
library(htmltools)

d <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer, class) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(panel = map_plot(data,
                          ~ figure(xlab = "City mpg", ylab = "Highway mpg") %>%
                            ly_points(cty, hwy, data = .x)))

joe <- d %>%
  trelliscope(name = "city_vs_highway_mpg", path = "two_trelli",
              self_contained = TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

<iframe src="two_trelli/index.html"><\iframe>
